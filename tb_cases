-- SQL Script to calculate TB infection rates by country and year

-- Assume the structure of tb_cases table is as follows:
-- tb_cases(country VARCHAR(255), year INT, cases INT)

-- Calculate TB infection rates
SELECT 
    p.country,
    p.year,
    IFNULL(SUM(t.cases), 0) AS TotalCases,  -- Handle NULL values by treating them as zero
    p.population,
    CASE 
        WHEN p.population > 0 THEN ROUND((IFNULL(SUM(t.cases), 0) / p.population) * 100000, 2)
        ELSE 0
    END AS RatePer100k  -- Calculate rates per 100,000 population
FROM 
    population p
LEFT JOIN 
    tb_cases t ON p.country = t.country AND p.year = t.year
GROUP BY 
    p.country, p.year
ORDER BY 
    p.country, p.year;
